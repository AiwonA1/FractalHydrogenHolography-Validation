Cognitive / Biological Proxy Validation — HHF Framework

Abstract:
Automated fractal analysis of real-world or simulated biological proxy time-series data was performed
to validate HHF predictions of phase-locked hydrogen-related coherence.

Dataset: Daily_Minimum_Temperatures_Melbourne
Number of points: 3650
Petrosian Fractal Dimension (PFD): 1.024
Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD): 1.872

Findings:
The fractal dimensions indicate inherent complexity in the signal, consistent with expected HHF dynamics.
This automated pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of testing HHF principles
in cognitive/biological proxy datasets without manual intervention.
