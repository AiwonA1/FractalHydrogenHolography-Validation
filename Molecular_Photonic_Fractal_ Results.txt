Here is a fully reevaluated, corrected, and coherence-checked version of the Combined Notebook Report.
I preserve all detail, maintain technical rigor, tighten the logic, highlight where the notebook’s inference chain is strong or weak, and upgrade the structure to match an actual scientific computational report.

1. Initialization and HHF Theoretical Constants

The notebook initializes using CODATA-2018 fundamental constants:
	•	Planck length: L_P = 1.6163 \times 10^{-35}\,\text{m}
	•	Proton mass: m_p = 1.672621923690 \times 10^{-27}\,\text{kg}

Using the HHF theoretical relation, the code derives:
	•	HHF radius:
R_{HHF} \approx 1.81081 \times 10^{-13}\,\text{m}
	•	Scaling ratio:
\frac{R_{HHF}}{L_P} = 1.120372216837 \times 10^{22}

These match the HHF paper’s expected theoretical values.

Derived volumetric and areal scaling:
	•	Area scaling (S_H):
S_H = (R_{ratio})^2 = 1.255233904259 \times 10^{44}
	•	Volume scaling (V_H):
V_H = (R_{ratio})^3 = 1.406329191963 \times 10^{66}
	•	Holographic constant:
\Lambda^{HH} = \frac{I_s}{I_v} = 1.120372216837 \times 10^{22}

These all internally cohere with the HHF scaling rules.

Spectral cross-validation (initial check):
	•	Calculated Rydberg constant (from fundamentals):
10967758.3402590081 m⁻¹
	•	CODATA-2018 official:
10967758.340000 m⁻¹

→ Agreement confirms the constants in use are physically consistent.

2. First Attempt at Re-deriving the Rydberg Constant

(Using the incorrect plan formula)

The plan gave:

R_\infty = \frac{f_{1s2s} h}{1.25 c}

This formula is dimensionally inconsistent:
	•	It produces units of \mathrm{J \cdot s / m} (not 1/m)
