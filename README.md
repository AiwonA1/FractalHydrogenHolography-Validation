Fractal Hydrogen Holography Validation

Mission:
To empirically validate the Fractal Hydrogen Holography Framework (HHF) across multiple domains, confirming its predictive power in atomic, molecular, and natural systems. This repository consolidates reproducible theoretical and empirical workflows to test Λᴴᴴ, PEFF, and fractal holographic patterns in real-world data.

The goal is to rigorously assess whether the framework’s predictions hold beyond a single calculation, establishing cross-domain evidence for fractal hydrogen holography.

🔎 Overview

The Fractal Hydrogen Holography Framework proposes that hydrogen systems encode fractal holographic patterns, linking atomic geometry to the Planck scale and governing higher-order coherence in molecular, biological, and geophysical systems.

This repository provides reproducible scripts and tools to validate these predictions, using high-precision constants, molecular datasets, and other publicly accessible empirical data.

What’s Known vs. Novel
	•	Known:
	•	Fundamental constants (CODATA 2018) and atomic hydrogen properties.
	•	Observed molecular geometries and bond lengths.
	•	Novel Predictions:
	•	Dimensionless Hydrogen Holographic Scaling Constant ($\Lambda^{HH}$).
	•	Paradise Energy Fractal Force (PEFF) detectable in natural systems (e.g., seismic activity).
	•	Cross-domain fractal coherence that links micro- and macro-scale phenomena.
	•	Prior Prediction:
	•	All theoretical values were published within HHF prior to the current empirical analyses.

🔬 Validation Approaches

1. Theoretical Validation
	•	Compute Λᴴᴴ and associated fractal ratios using high-precision CODATA constants.
	•	Confirms internal consistency of HHF.

2. Empirical Proxy Validation
	•	Molecular data (NIST, PubChem, ChEMBL) for effective hydrogen radii and surface/volume ratios.
	•	Seismic (USGS GEAR) and other natural datasets for fractal harmonic coherence.
	•	Tests whether HHF predictions hold in observable systems beyond the atomic scale.

3. Cross-Domain Predictions
	•	Future steps: biological, photonic, and materials datasets.
	•	Aim to replicate fractal holographic patterns across multiple independent systems.
