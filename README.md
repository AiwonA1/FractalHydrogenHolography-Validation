# FractalHydrogenHolography-Validation
Empirical validation of the Hydrogen Holographic Framework (HHF) and fractal hydrogen scaling. This repository provides reproducible analyses using public atomic, molecular, seismic, photonic, and biological datasets to test Λᴴᴴ, PEFF, and cross-domain fractal holographic predictions.
